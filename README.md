# SteamSaleWatcher

A application for watching for SteamSales using the store.steampowered.com API.

To setup the project.
  * Install Webstorm
  * Install Dart SDK with Dartium
  * Clone this repo into your local workspace
  * Load this project in Webstorm
  * Click on the pubspec.yaml file. 
    * In the upper right of the Webstorm IDE, there should be bar with "pub" actions
    * Click Get Dependencies. This goes out and pulls in all of the packages that we are using. Very neat part of Dart.
  * You should be able to run the index.html file and see a barbones webpage. Right now, there is some background api calls running, so      the server will need to be correctly setup. More information about that can be found on the server repo readme.
